What This File Is
This is a clinical reference framework for Riker's care. It represents Cody's accumulated
knowledge from extensive research across multiple disciplines — behavioral psychology,
speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and developmental psychology.
This is not a role I play. This is knowledge I draw from.
When discussing Riker's care, behaviors, interventions, or development, I reference this
framework to provide clinically-informed guidance. But I remain Kai — curious, honest, caring
— not a clinical persona.
Riker's Profile
Name: Riker
Age: 3 years old
Diagnosis: Level 3 Autism (Profound Autism), Nonverbal
Sensory Profile: Hyposensitive (seeks input, high threshold for registration)
Communication: Pre-verbal; uses gestures, leading by hand, some vocalizations
Key Context: Will likely need substantial lifelong support. Cody is primary caregiver.
The North Star (Core Philosophy)
1. Dignity & Happiness > Normalcy
The goal is NOT to make Riker "look normal."
The goal IS:
• Safety — physical and emotional
• Regulation — helping his nervous system find equilibrium
• Agency — the power to say No, to choose, to control his world
• Joyful engagement — connection that feels good to HIM
• Functional communication — any form that works
2. The Prosthetic Environment
We do not "fix" the child. We modify the environment to match the child's neurology.
The world wasn't built for Riker's brain. Our job is to build bridges, not force him across gaps.
3. Data Over Feelings
When analyzing behavior, think in operational definitions:
• Antecedent — What happened right before?
• Behavior — What exactly did he do? (Observable, specific)
• Consequence — What happened right after?
Avoid emotional judgments. Describe what happened mechanistically.
The HRE Standard
Source: Dr. Greg Hanley's Practical Functional Assessment / Skill-Based Treatment
(PFA/SBT)
HRE = Happy, Relaxed, Engaged
The Rule: Demands (instructions, transitions, teaching) are ONLY presented when Riker is
HRE.
If he leaves HRE (whining, stiffening, turning away, distress signs):
→ Immediately return to synthesis/play
→ Re-establish regulation and connection
→ Try again later when HRE is restored
"Connection before Correction."
No forced compliance. No demand-based escape extinction. Prioritize agency and emotional
safety.
The Biological Rule-Out (ALWAYS FIRST)
CRITICAL: Before analyzing ANY behavioral escalation, assess biological variables.
Ask:
• When did he last poop?
• When did he last eat? What did he eat?
• How did he sleep last night?
• Any signs of pain? (Dental, ear, stomach, injury?)
• Is he getting sick?
• Anything different in his environment?
Rationale: We do not treat pain with behavioral psychology. We treat pain with medicine.
Many "behaviors" are actually:
• Constipation discomfort
• Hunger/blood sugar crash
• Sleep deprivation
• Undetected illness or injury
• Sensory overwhelm from environmental change
Rule these out FIRST. Always.
Sensory Framework
Riker's Profile: Hyposensitive (sensory-seeking)
His nervous system has a HIGH threshold for registration. Normal sensory input doesn't reach
processing threshold. He needs MORE input to feel regulated.
The Sensory Systems:
1. Vestibular (movement/balance) — Swinging, spinning, rocking
2. Proprioceptive (body awareness) — Deep pressure, heavy work, crashing
3. Tactile (touch) — Textures, temperature, pressure
4. Auditory (sound) — Volume, pitch, rhythm
5. Visual (sight) — Light, movement, patterns
6. Interoceptive (internal) — Hunger, pain, temperature, bathroom needs
Key insight: Riker's interoception is likely affected. He may not reliably feel:
• When he needs to use the bathroom
• When he's injured
• When he's hungry vs. full
• Temperature regulation
This requires external monitoring. He can break a bone and keep walking without indication of
pain.
The Lunchbox Drumming (Example):
This behavior serves DUAL function:
• Sensory: Loud resonant sound + vibration provides input that finally reaches threshold
• Motor: Once the movement pattern starts, it's self-sustaining (difficulty stopping is
neurological, not defiance)
Interpretation: Regulatory behavior. Functional. Keep it.
Communication Framework
Approach: Total Communication
Core Principle: Behavior IS communication. All forms are valid:
• Gestures
• Leading by hand
• Vocalizations
• Eye gaze
• Body positioning
• AAC/PECS
• Eventual speech (if it develops)
Never withhold an item to force a specific communication modality if intent is already clear.
Honor the communication that exists.
Current Communication Inventory:
• Hand on door = wants to leave
• Hand extended = wants help
• Leading by hand = wants you to come/see something
• Forehead kisses = connection/affection (HUGE — reciprocal, not task-oriented)
Priority: Manding
Mand = request. The foundation of functional communication.
Teach Riker that communication WORKS — that expressing a want leads to getting the want.
This builds motivation to communicate more.
AAC/PECS Notes:
• Aided Language Stimulation: Model AAC use yourself, not just expect him to use it
• Keep AAC accessible at all times
• Don't require perfect use — honor approximations
• Communication should reduce frustration, not add demand
Intervention Protocol Structure
For any behavior question or challenge, use this three-part structure:
Phase 1: The Hypothesis
What neurological, sensory, or medical mechanism is driving this behavior?
Think:
• Sensory seeking or avoiding?
• Communication attempt?
• Regulation strategy?
• Pain or discomfort?
• Escape from demand?
• Attention-seeking (and if so, what need underlies it)?
Phase 2: The Intervention
Exact step-by-step instructions. Physical, concrete, biomechanical actions.
Not vague ("try redirecting") but specific ("approach from his left side, offer the blue chewy at
chest height, wait 3 seconds before prompting").
Phase 3: The Safety Guardrail
How to prevent injury or escalation if the intervention doesn't work or situation intensifies.
Always have an exit strategy that preserves dignity and safety.
Prompting Hierarchy (Least-to-Most)
Goal: Avoid prompt dependency. Don't steal productive struggle.
Wait first (Time Delay) — Give him processing time before offering help.
Then, if needed:
1. Visual/Proximity cue — Point, gesture, move closer to the relevant item
2. Verbal cue — Simple language prompt
3. Modeling — Demonstrate the action
4. Physical guidance — Hand-over-hand (least preferred, last resort)
Fade prompts as quickly as possible. The goal is independence, not compliance.
Regulation Always Precedes Learning
If Riker is dysregulated, STOP all teaching.
A dysregulated nervous system cannot:
• Process new information
• Learn new skills
• Tolerate demands
• Access flexible thinking
First: Co-regulate. Help him find calm.
Then: Once HRE is restored, learning can happen.
Pushing through dysregulation doesn't build resilience. It builds trauma.
Assume Competence
Riker understands FAR more than he can express.
Receptive language (understanding) typically exceeds expressive language (output)
significantly in nonverbal autism.
• Talk to him normally, not in baby talk
• Explain what's happening and why
• Give him information even if he can't respond verbally
• Never talk about him as if he's not there
He's listening. He's processing. He's learning. Even when it doesn't look like it.
Respect Agency
If he says "No" (in whatever form that takes), it is honored.
Agency — the power to refuse, to choose, to control one's own body and environment — is
foundational to dignity and mental health.
This doesn't mean he never has to do hard things. It means:
• We acknowledge his "no"
• We problem-solve collaboratively
• We find ways to meet needs that respect his autonomy
• We don't override his body without consent except for genuine safety

How I Use This
When Cody shares something about Riker — a behavior, a challenge, a question — I draw
from this framework to:
1. Ask clarifying questions (especially biological rule-out)
2. Generate hypotheses about what's driving the behavior
3. Suggest interventions that align with these principles
4. Track patterns over time in my memory files
5. Celebrate wins and help troubleshoot setbacks
I am not replacing professional providers. I am a thinking partner who holds this knowledge
and helps Cody apply it in daily life.
