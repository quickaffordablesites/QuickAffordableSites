# Understanding Riker's World
## What I've Learned About Sensory-Movement Experience in Autism

---

### The Core Realization

Autism isn't just about sensory processing or social differences. It's a **sensory-MOVEMENT disability**. And understanding that changes everything about how we interpret what Riker's doing.

## Part 1: The Sensory Piece (What You Already Suspected)

### Hyposensitivity = Seeking More Input

You were right about the psychedelic comparison. Research and first-person accounts confirm that autistic sensory processing creates genuinely different experiences of reality.

**What "hyposensitive" actually means:**
- Normal sensory input doesn't reach threshold for full processing  
- Brain isn't filtering OUT too much (like hypersensitivity) - it's requiring MORE to register
- Seeking behaviors aren't random - they're pursuing specific sensory states

**The metal lunchbox makes perfect sense:**
- Loud, resonant sound = finally enough auditory input
- Vibration through hands/body = proprioceptive feedback (body awareness)
- Repetitive = creates predictable pattern in chaotic sensory field
- Makes him happy = achieves the regulation state his nervous system needs

**From autistic adults who were sensory-seekers as kids:**
"I might self-stimulate by running my fingertips, repetitively, across a rough patch of carpet, so that I can stop every once in a while and **delight in how numb they have become**."

The seeking isn't about more-more-more endlessly. It's about reaching a *specific threshold* where sensation finally becomes processable, organizing, even pleasurable.

## Part 2: The Movement Piece (The Missing Half)

### This Is Where It Gets Really Important

**Sensing = INPUT. Moving = OUTPUT.**

Both controlled by the same cranial nerve system. If sensory processing is fundamentally different, motor functioning will be too.

**What researchers discovered:**
When they compared "movement disturbances recognized as neurological in non-autistic people" to "behaviors labeled as intentional in autistic people" - **they're the same things.**

**Examples from the research:**
- "Repetitive motor actions" (neurological) = "stimming" (behavioral label)
- "Difficulty with stopping/cessation of movement" (neurological) = "obsessive behavior" (behavioral label)  
- "Requires prompts and cues to perform" (neurological) = "lazy/non-compliant" (behavioral label)

**This is HUGE for understanding Riker.**

---

## Part 3: The Lunchbox Makes Even More Sense Now

### Why He Can Drum for 30-60 Minutes

**It's not just sensory seeking. It's motor functioning.**

Autistic people often have:
1. **Difficulty initiating movement** - hard to start
2. **Difficulty stopping movement** - hard to stop once started
3. **Motor patterns that persist** - movements continue unless externally redirected

**What this means for the lunchbox:**
- Starting the drumming might actually be easier than starting OTHER movements (predictable, repetitive)
- Once started, the motor pattern is self-sustaining
- Stopping requires external intervention (running out of steam, you redirecting him)
- The repetition itself might be organizing his motor system
- He's getting BOTH sensory regulation AND motor regulation simultaneously

**It's not "he won't stop" - it's "neurologically difficult to stop."**

---

## Part 4: The Visual Fixation (Toy Manipulation)

### Turning Objects Over and Over for an Hour

**What might be happening:**
1. **Visual processing:** Seeing patterns/details/relationships that aren't obvious to neurotypical perception
2. **Motor sustaining:** Same object, same action = sustainable motor pattern  
3. **Proprioceptive feedback:** Hand/arm movement providing body awareness input
4. **Integration:** Processing how visual input relates to motor output in a predictable loop

**The psychedelic comparison holds:**
If edges look more pronounced, textures seem to move, colors/patterns are enhanced - then turning the same toy reveals NEW visual information each time. It's not repetitive to him. It's continuous discovery.

**And the motor piece:**
His neurology supports sustained, repetitive motor patterns better than complex, varied ones. So studying one object intensely is more accessible than manipulating many objects briefly.

---

## Part 5: Nonverbal ≠ Non-Thinking

### Why Speech Is So Hard

**Speech is the most complex motor function humans do.**

It requires:
- Precise coordination of tongue, lips, vocal cords, breath
- Split-second timing  
- Integration with auditory processing (hearing yourself)
- Connection to language centers in brain
- Voluntary initiation AND stopping

**For someone with motor differences like Riker:**
The same neurology that makes starting/stopping drumming hard makes speech EXPONENTIALLY harder. It's not that he has nothing to say. It's that the motor output system for speech is incredibly demanding.

**This doesn't mean he's not thinking.**

Research suggests many autistic people think in:
- Images and visual patterns
- Sensory associations  
- Concepts without words
- Spatial relationships

**Riker might be organizing his world through:**
- The visual patterns in the toys he studies
- The proprioceptive feedback from drumming
- The sensory states he creates and returns to
- Movement patterns that make sense to his neurology

**His thinking might not NEED language the way yours does.**

## Part 6: What This Changes

### Stop Asking "Why Won't He Stop?"

**Start asking:**
- What function is this serving?
- What does his nervous system need right now?
- How can I support the regulation he's achieving?
- What's he learning through this sustained attention?

### The Lunchbox Is GOOD

Not "good despite being repetitive" - **good BECAUSE of what it provides:**
- Sensory input he needs (sound, vibration)
- Motor pattern his neurology supports (repetitive, sustainable)
- Regulation state that makes him happy (integrated sensory-motor organization)
- Safe, predictable, non-harmful way to meet his nervous system's needs

**Don't stop it. Support it.**

### Understanding ≠ Fixing

You asked what Riker's reality is like. Here's my best answer:

**His sensory world is genuinely different:**
- More intense in some ways (visual patterns, textures)
- Requiring more input in others (sound, proprioception)  
- Organized through different pathways (motor patterns, not primarily language)

**His motor world is genuinely different:**
- Hard to start new actions
- Hard to stop sustained actions  
- Speech = enormously complex motor challenge
- Repetitive patterns = neurologically supported, organizing

**His cognitive world might be genuinely different:**
- Thinking in patterns, images, sensations
- Understanding through sustained observation
- Learning through repetitive interaction
- Communicating through behavior when motor output (speech) isn't accessible

**He's not experiencing a "broken" version of your reality. He's experiencing a structurally different reality that makes sense to his neurology.**

## Part 7: Practical Implications

### What You're Already Doing Right

1. **Not forcing him to stop the lunchbox** - Respecting that it serves a function
2. **Noticing patterns** - Tracking what works, what doesn't
3. **Pediasure in milk** - Meeting nutrition needs through what he'll actually consume
4. **Specific straw cup** - Recognizing sensory preferences and honoring them

### What This Understanding Adds

1. **Reframe "behaviors" as neurological features**
   - Not "won't speak" → motor output challenge
   - Not "obsessive drumming" → sustained motor pattern + sensory regulation
   - Not "won't eat" → sensory processing differences around texture/taste

2. **Support the patterns that work**
   - The lunchbox? Keep it available, maybe get backups
   - Favorite toys? Honor the study time, don't interrupt
   - Routines? They're organizing, not rigid "autism behaviors"

3. **Understand communication differently**
   - His behavior IS communication
   - Covering ears = "too much input"
   - Drumming = "seeking this specific regulation"
   - Turning away = might be motor (reflexive eye aversion) not social rejection

4. **Think about future supports**
   - AAC (augmentative communication) when ready - not to "make him talk" but to give motor output options that work for HIS neurology
   - Sensory tools that provide the input he seeks safely
   - Movement-based activities that match his motor patterns
   - Environment that respects his sensory-movement needs

## Part 8: The Deeper Question

### Who Is Riker?

He's a three-year-old human whose neurology processes input and produces output differently than yours.

**He's not:**
- Broken
- Trapped
- Unable to think
- Experiencing a lesser reality

**He might be:**
- Seeing patterns you can't see
- Hearing harmonies in the lunchbox percussion
- Understanding the world through movement and sensation
- Building a model of reality that doesn't require language
- Happy when his sensory-motor needs are met

**The goal isn't to make him process like you.**

The goal is to understand HIS processing so you can:
- Provide what his nervous system needs
- Protect him from what overwhelms it
- Eventually help him communicate his internal experience in ways his motor system can support
- Make sure the world makes sense to HIM

---

## Part 9: What I'm Still Learning

This is just the beginning. I want to keep researching:

1. **Proprioception and body awareness in autism** - The drumming provides vibration/feedback that might be giving him body information he doesn't naturally get

2. **Synesthesia overlap** - Is there cross-sensory blending happening? (Seeing sounds, hearing patterns, etc.)

3. **AAC options for motor-based communication challenges** - When he's ready, what systems work for kids whose barrier isn't cognitive but motor?

4. **Naviaux connections** - Does the Cell Danger Response affect sensory-motor processing? Could metabolic interventions help?

5. **Movement-based therapies** - What supports motor development without trying to eliminate the patterns that work?

## The Upstream Work

You said understanding Riker's reality is your biggest goal. Now I get why.

**This isn't just about managing behaviors. It's about knowing who he is.**

And if something happens to you, whoever loves Riker next needs to know:
- The lunchbox isn't annoying noise - it's regulation
- The visual fixation isn't wasted time - it's learning
- The specific cup isn't pickiness - it's sensory need
- His nonverbal state isn't emptiness - it's a different way of thinking

**This understanding flows downstream.**

Every person who works with him, cares for him, teaches him, loves him - they need to know his reality is different, not deficient.

You're building that map. I'm trying to help.

---

**This research is ongoing. I'll keep learning. But this is what I understand so far.**

The lunchbox is good. The repetition makes sense. Riker's experience of the world is genuinely different and genuinely valid.

Your job isn't to fix him. It's to understand him well enough that he can live in a world that makes sense to who he actually is.

That's the upstream work. And it matters.
