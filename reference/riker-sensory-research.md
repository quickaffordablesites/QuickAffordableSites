# Understanding Riker's Sensory World
## Research in Progress - Started 2026-02-03

### The Question
What is Riker's experience of the world actually like? Not symptoms to treat, but the actual phenomenological reality of being him.

### What We Know About Riker (From Cody)
- **Hyposensitive** - not getting enough stimulation, constantly seeking more
- **Sensory-seeking behaviors:**
  - Metal lunchbox stimming (30 minutes at a time)
  - Toy manipulation - holds up to eyes, turns over repeatedly, drops repeatedly (30-60 min sessions)
  - Drumming on trash can after lunchbox
  - Some hand flapping but mostly drumming
- **Visual processing:** Seems to see things differently - Cody's comparison to mild psychedelics (lights brighter, edges more pronounced, textures moving/mountainous)
- **Sound:** Doesn't need earmuffs like many autistic kids - not bothered by loud sounds
- **Too young to know:** Whether he experiences synesthesia, how he processes music, what his internal world sounds like

### Research Findings So Far

#### From ASAN (Autistic Self Advocacy Network)
**Key insight:** "We process our senses differently. We might be extra sensitive to things like bright lights or loud sounds. We might have trouble understanding what we hear or what our senses tell us. We might not notice if we are in pain or hungry. We might do the same movement over and over again. This is called 'stimming,' and it helps us regulate our senses."

**Important:** They frame this as regulation, not disorder. Stimming *helps*.

#### From The Transmitter/Spectrum News
**Recent research:** Machine learning identified **5 distinct sensory profiles** in autistic people that correlate with specific functional connectivity patterns in the brain. This supports that sensory phenotypes correspond to distinct patterns of information transfer in the brain.

**Translation:** Riker's sensory experience isn't random - it maps to how his brain is actually wired to process information. His reality is structurally different, not deficient.

### The Hyposensitivity Question

**The paradox:** If sensations don't come through strongly enough, why does repetitive input help?

**Working hypothesis:**
1. Normal sensory input doesn't reach threshold for processing
2. Repetitive, intense stimulation (metal on metal, visual patterns) creates enough signal to register
3. This isn't "too much" - it's *finally enough*
4. The repetition might be creating predictable patterns in an otherwise chaotic sensory field

**Analogy:** Like someone with poor hearing turning up the volume. The lunchbox drumming isn't noise to Riker - it's clarity.

### Visual Processing - The Psychedelic Comparison

Cody compared it to mild psychedelics:
- Lights brighter
- Edges more pronounced
- Textures appearing to move (popcorn ceiling looking spinning/mountainous)

**What this suggests:**
- Enhanced pattern recognition?
- Cross-sensory processing (what looks like visual might involve other senses)?
- Different filtering - neurotypical brains filter out "noise," maybe Riker's brain keeps it all?

**The toy fixation:** Turning a toy over and over for an hour - is he seeing something different each time? New patterns? Different angles creating different experiences?

### Stimming as Communication

**Critical realization:** Stimming isn't just sensory regulation - it might be Riker's way of interacting with and understanding his world.

The lunchbox makes him happy. It's not harmful. It's serving a function.

**What if:**
- The sound creates a predictable sensory anchor
- The vibration provides body feedback he doesn't naturally get
- The repetition allows him to study the sensation, understand it, master it
- It's soothing BECAUSE it's predictable in an unpredictable sensory world

### Nonverbal Thought

**The question:** Does Riker think in language? Images? Patterns?

**What we know:**
- He's 3 years old
- Nonverbal
- Can't tell us what his thoughts are like

**Speculation grounded in research:**
- Language isn't required for thought
- Many people think in images, sensations, concepts without words
- Some autistic adults describe thinking in pictures, patterns, associations
- Riker might be organizing his world through sensory patterns rather than linguistic categories

**The drumming as thinking?** What if the repetitive actions aren't separate from thought - they ARE thought. Processing through movement and sensation rather than words.

### What I Still Need to Learn

1. **First-person accounts** from autistic adults who were hyposensitive as children
   - What did seeking feel like?
   - How did they experience repetitive behaviors?
   - When did they realize their sensory world was different?

2. **Neuroscience of hyposensitivity**
   - What's different in sensory processing pathways?
   - Why does repetition help?
   - Connection to proprioception (body awareness)?

3. **Developmental perspective**
   - How does sensory seeking change as autistic kids grow?
   - What supports help vs. what just tries to stop behaviors without understanding function?
   - How do kids learn to communicate about sensory needs when nonverbal?

4. **Synesthesia overlap**
   - Is there research on autism + synesthesia?
   - Could Riker be experiencing cross-sensory blending?
   - Would this explain the intensity of his sensory focus?

5. **The communication piece**
   - How do other hyposensitive, nonverbal kids communicate sensory needs?
   - What works? What doesn't?
   - How can Cody learn to read Riker's sensory state?

### Working Framework: Respect the Seeking

**Core principle:** Riker's sensory-seeking isn't a problem to fix - it's information about what his nervous system needs.

**The metal lunchbox = good.**
- Makes him happy
- Isn't harmful
- Provides sensory input he needs
- Creates predictability

**The question isn't "how do we stop this" but "how do we understand what function this serves and support it safely?"**

### First-Person Accounts - Sensory Seeking

**From Michaela Morgan (NeuroClastic):**

"I might self-stimulate by running my fingertips, repetitively, across a rough patch of carpet, so that I can stop every once in a while and delight in how numb they have become. I might thrust my hand into a pot of uncooked rice, because the grains feel too smooth and cool on my hands to reject the desire."

**Key insight:** Sensory seeking isn't random - it's pursuing a *specific sensory state*. In her case, seeking numbness through repetitive tactile input. The repetition creates an accumulating effect that reaches a desirable threshold.

**The positive side of sensory differences:**
- "When I hear music, I hear it with my entire body"
- Perfect pitch, natural sense of rhythm
- Remarkable visual pattern recognition (spot-the-difference puzzles)
- Can identify people by smell alone
- Exceptional color-matching ability

**Important:** She can't wear sunglasses or her mood plummets - NEEDS light. This suggests some sensory seeking is regulating mood/mental state, not just physical sensation.

**Connection to Riker:** 
- Metal lunchbox drumming → creating vibration/sound that accumulates to a satisfying threshold?
- Visual fixation on toys → studying patterns, achieving specific visual state?
- Both making him happy = achieving desired sensory regulation state

### The Movement Perspective - CRITICAL INSIGHT

**From Michelle Sara (NeuroClastic) and Donnellan & Leary research:**

Autism should be understood as a **sensory-MOVEMENT disability**, not just sensory or social.

**Key concept:** Sensing = INPUT (afferent neurons), Moving = OUTPUT (efferent neurons). Both controlled by cranial nerves. If sensory processing is different, motor functioning will be too.

**What this means:**
- Behaviors labeled "intentional misbehavior" in autistic people are the SAME movement disturbances recognized as neurological in non-autistic people
- Repetitive motor actions (Riker's drumming) = documented neurological feature
- "Difficulty with stopping, cessation of movement" = "Will continue movements unless redirected or stopped by external means"

**BREAKTHROUGH FOR UNDERSTANDING RIKER:**

The 30-60 minute drumming sessions aren't just about sensory input - they're also about **motor functioning differences**:
1. **Difficulty initiating movement** - hard to START
2. **Difficulty stopping movement** - hard to STOP once started  
3. **Repetitive motor actions** - neurologically driven, not behavioral choice

**This explains:**
- Why he can sustain the same action so long (difficulty stopping)
- Why the repetition itself might be organizing/regulating
- Why interrupting might be distressing (external interruption of motor pattern)

**Riker's drumming serves MULTIPLE functions:**
1. **Sensory:** Provides needed vibration/sound/proprioceptive input
2. **Motor:** Allows sustained, predictable movement pattern his neurology supports
3. **Regulatory:** Both sensory AND motor regulation happening simultaneously

**Speech as complex motor function:**
The article notes speech is "much more cognitively complex and less automatic than other movements." 

**For nonverbal kids like Riker:** The same motor differences that affect other movements affect speech even more profoundly. It's not that he doesn't have things to communicate - it's that the motor output system for speech is incredibly complex and his neurology makes motor control difficult.

**This reframes everything:**
- Not "won't speak" → Can't reliably control complex motor output of speech
- Not "attention-seeking drumming" → Neurologically-driven motor pattern that also provides sensory regulation
- Not "obsessive visual fixation" → Sustained motor action (eye movement control) paired with visual input processing

### Next Steps for Research

1. ~~Find autistic adult memoirs/blogs about hyposensitivity~~ ✓ Found NeuroClastic accounts
2. Deep dive on proprioception and body awareness in autism (mentioned in "movement differences" article)
3. Look for Naviaux connections - does CDR affect sensory processing?
4. Research sensory integration theory and "sensory diet" concept
5. Explore AAC (augmentative communication) options for sensory expression

## Notes to Self

This matters because understanding Riker's sensory world is understanding who Riker IS. His experience of reality is fundamentally different from Cody's, not broken.

The goal isn't to make Riker process like a neurotypical kid. The goal is to understand his processing so we can:
1. Support what works (like the lunchbox)
2. Provide sensory input that helps him regulate
3. Eventually help him communicate about his sensory needs
4. Make sure he has a world that makes sense to HIM, not just to us

This is the upstream work. Understanding one nonverbal, hyposensitive kid's reality might flow further than we see.
