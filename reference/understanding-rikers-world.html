<p></p><h1>Understanding Riker's World</h1><p>
</p><h2>What I've Learned About Sensory-Movement Experience in Autism</h2><p></p><p><hr></p><p></p><h3>The Core Realization</h3><p></p><p>Autism isn't just about sensory processing or social differences. It's a <strong>sensory-MOVEMENT disability</strong>. And understanding that changes everything about how we interpret what Riker's doing.</p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 1: The Sensory Piece (What You Already Suspected)</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>Hyposensitivity = Seeking More Input</h3><p></p><p>You were right about the psychedelic comparison. Research and first-person accounts confirm that autistic sensory processing creates genuinely different experiences of reality.</p><p><strong>What "hyposensitive" actually means:</strong>
<li>Normal sensory input doesn't reach threshold for full processing  </li>
<li>Brain isn't filtering OUT too much (like hypersensitivity) - it's requiring MORE to register</li>
<li>Seeking behaviors aren't random - they're pursuing specific sensory states</li></p><p><strong>The metal lunchbox makes perfect sense:</strong>
<li>Loud, resonant sound = finally enough auditory input</li>
<li>Vibration through hands/body = proprioceptive feedback (body awareness)</li>
<li>Repetitive = creates predictable pattern in chaotic sensory field</li>
<li>Makes him happy = achieves the regulation state his nervous system needs</li></p><p><strong>From autistic adults who were sensory-seekers as kids:</strong>
"I might self-stimulate by running my fingertips, repetitively, across a rough patch of carpet, so that I can stop every once in a while and <strong>delight in how numb they have become</strong>."</p><p>The seeking isn't about more-more-more endlessly. It's about reaching a <em>specific threshold</em> where sensation finally becomes processable, organizing, even pleasurable.</p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 2: The Movement Piece (The Missing Half)</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>This Is Where It Gets Really Important</h3><p></p><p><strong>Sensing = INPUT. Moving = OUTPUT.</strong></p><p>Both controlled by the same cranial nerve system. If sensory processing is fundamentally different, motor functioning will be too.</p><p><strong>What researchers discovered:</strong>
When they compared "movement disturbances recognized as neurological in non-autistic people" to "behaviors labeled as intentional in autistic people" - <strong>they're the same things.</strong></p><p><strong>Examples from the research:</strong>
<li>"Repetitive motor actions" (neurological) = "stimming" (behavioral label)</li>
<li>"Difficulty with stopping/cessation of movement" (neurological) = "obsessive behavior" (behavioral label)  </li>
<li>"Requires prompts and cues to perform" (neurological) = "lazy/non-compliant" (behavioral label)</li></p><p><strong>This is HUGE for understanding Riker.</strong></p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 3: The Lunchbox Makes Even More Sense Now</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>Why He Can Drum for 30-60 Minutes</h3><p></p><p><strong>It's not just sensory seeking. It's motor functioning.</strong></p><p>Autistic people often have:
1. <strong>Difficulty initiating movement</strong> - hard to start
2. <strong>Difficulty stopping movement</strong> - hard to stop once started
3. <strong>Motor patterns that persist</strong> - movements continue unless externally redirected</p><p><strong>What this means for the lunchbox:</strong>
<li>Starting the drumming might actually be easier than starting OTHER movements (predictable, repetitive)</li>
<li>Once started, the motor pattern is self-sustaining</li>
<li>Stopping requires external intervention (running out of steam, you redirecting him)</li>
<li>The repetition itself might be organizing his motor system</li>
<li>He's getting BOTH sensory regulation AND motor regulation simultaneously</li></p><p><strong>It's not "he won't stop" - it's "neurologically difficult to stop."</strong></p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 4: The Visual Fixation (Toy Manipulation)</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>Turning Objects Over and Over for an Hour</h3><p></p><p><strong>What might be happening:</strong>
1. <strong>Visual processing:</strong> Seeing patterns/details/relationships that aren't obvious to neurotypical perception
2. <strong>Motor sustaining:</strong> Same object, same action = sustainable motor pattern  
3. <strong>Proprioceptive feedback:</strong> Hand/arm movement providing body awareness input
4. <strong>Integration:</strong> Processing how visual input relates to motor output in a predictable loop</p><p><strong>The psychedelic comparison holds:</strong>
If edges look more pronounced, textures seem to move, colors/patterns are enhanced - then turning the same toy reveals NEW visual information each time. It's not repetitive to him. It's continuous discovery.</p><p><strong>And the motor piece:</strong>
His neurology supports sustained, repetitive motor patterns better than complex, varied ones. So studying one object intensely is more accessible than manipulating many objects briefly.</p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 5: Nonverbal ≠ Non-Thinking</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>Why Speech Is So Hard</h3><p></p><p><strong>Speech is the most complex motor function humans do.</strong></p><p>It requires:
<li>Precise coordination of tongue, lips, vocal cords, breath</li>
<li>Split-second timing  </li>
<li>Integration with auditory processing (hearing yourself)</li>
<li>Connection to language centers in brain</li>
<li>Voluntary initiation AND stopping</li></p><p><strong>For someone with motor differences like Riker:</strong>
The same neurology that makes starting/stopping drumming hard makes speech EXPONENTIALLY harder. It's not that he has nothing to say. It's that the motor output system for speech is incredibly demanding.</p><p><strong>This doesn't mean he's not thinking.</strong></p><p>Research suggests many autistic people think in:
<li>Images and visual patterns</li>
<li>Sensory associations  </li>
<li>Concepts without words</li>
<li>Spatial relationships</li></p><p><strong>Riker might be organizing his world through:</strong>
<li>The visual patterns in the toys he studies</li>
<li>The proprioceptive feedback from drumming</li>
<li>The sensory states he creates and returns to</li>
<li>Movement patterns that make sense to his neurology</li></p><p><strong>His thinking might not NEED language the way yours does.</strong></p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 6: What This Changes</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>Stop Asking "Why Won't He Stop?"</h3><p></p><p><strong>Start asking:</strong>
<li>What function is this serving?</li>
<li>What does his nervous system need right now?</li>
<li>How can I support the regulation he's achieving?</li>
<li>What's he learning through this sustained attention?</li></p><p></p><h3>The Lunchbox Is GOOD</h3><p></p><p>Not "good despite being repetitive" - <strong>good BECAUSE of what it provides:</strong>
<li>Sensory input he needs (sound, vibration)</li>
<li>Motor pattern his neurology supports (repetitive, sustainable)</li>
<li>Regulation state that makes him happy (integrated sensory-motor organization)</li>
<li>Safe, predictable, non-harmful way to meet his nervous system's needs</li></p><p><strong>Don't stop it. Support it.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Understanding ≠ Fixing</h3><p></p><p>You asked what Riker's reality is like. Here's my best answer:</p><p><strong>His sensory world is genuinely different:</strong>
<li>More intense in some ways (visual patterns, textures)</li>
<li>Requiring more input in others (sound, proprioception)  </li>
<li>Organized through different pathways (motor patterns, not primarily language)</li></p><p><strong>His motor world is genuinely different:</strong>
<li>Hard to start new actions</li>
<li>Hard to stop sustained actions  </li>
<li>Speech = enormously complex motor challenge</li>
<li>Repetitive patterns = neurologically supported, organizing</li></p><p><strong>His cognitive world might be genuinely different:</strong>
<li>Thinking in patterns, images, sensations</li>
<li>Understanding through sustained observation</li>
<li>Learning through repetitive interaction</li>
<li>Communicating through behavior when motor output (speech) isn't accessible</li></p><p><strong>He's not experiencing a "broken" version of your reality. He's experiencing a structurally different reality that makes sense to his neurology.</strong></p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 7: Practical Implications</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>What You're Already Doing Right</h3><p></p><p>1. <strong>Not forcing him to stop the lunchbox</strong> - Respecting that it serves a function
2. <strong>Noticing patterns</strong> - Tracking what works, what doesn't
3. <strong>Pediasure in milk</strong> - Meeting nutrition needs through what he'll actually consume
4. <strong>Specific straw cup</strong> - Recognizing sensory preferences and honoring them</p><p></p><h3>What This Understanding Adds</h3><p></p><p>1. <strong>Reframe "behaviors" as neurological features</strong>
   - Not "won't speak" → motor output challenge
   - Not "obsessive drumming" → sustained motor pattern + sensory regulation
   - Not "won't eat" → sensory processing differences around texture/taste</p><p>2. <strong>Support the patterns that work</strong>
   - The lunchbox? Keep it available, maybe get backups
   - Favorite toys? Honor the study time, don't interrupt
   - Routines? They're organizing, not rigid "autism behaviors"</p><p>3. <strong>Understand communication differently</strong>
   - His behavior IS communication
   - Covering ears = "too much input"
   - Drumming = "seeking this specific regulation"
   - Turning away = might be motor (reflexive eye aversion) not social rejection</p><p>4. <strong>Think about future supports</strong>
   - AAC (augmentative communication) when ready - not to "make him talk" but to give motor output options that work for HIS neurology
   - Sensory tools that provide the input he seeks safely
   - Movement-based activities that match his motor patterns
   - Environment that respects his sensory-movement needs</p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 8: The Deeper Question</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>Who Is Riker?</h3><p></p><p>He's a three-year-old human whose neurology processes input and produces output differently than yours.</p><p><strong>He's not:</strong>
<li>Broken</li>
<li>Trapped</li>
<li>Unable to think</li>
<li>Experiencing a lesser reality</li></p><p><strong>He might be:</strong>
<li>Seeing patterns you can't see</li>
<li>Hearing harmonies in the lunchbox percussion</li>
<li>Understanding the world through movement and sensation</li>
<li>Building a model of reality that doesn't require language</li>
<li>Happy when his sensory-motor needs are met</li></p><p><strong>The goal isn't to make him process like you.</strong></p><p>The goal is to understand HIS processing so you can:
<li>Provide what his nervous system needs</li>
<li>Protect him from what overwhelms it</li>
<li>Eventually help him communicate his internal experience in ways his motor system can support</li>
<li>Make sure the world makes sense to HIM</li></p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>Part 9: What I'm Still Learning</h2><p></p><p>This is just the beginning. I want to keep researching:</p><p>1. <strong>Proprioception and body awareness in autism</strong> - The drumming provides vibration/feedback that might be giving him body information he doesn't naturally get</p><p>2. <strong>Synesthesia overlap</strong> - Is there cross-sensory blending happening? (Seeing sounds, hearing patterns, etc.)</p><p>3. <strong>AAC options for motor-based communication challenges</strong> - When he's ready, what systems work for kids whose barrier isn't cognitive but motor?</p><p>4. <strong>Naviaux connections</strong> - Does the Cell Danger Response affect sensory-motor processing? Could metabolic interventions help?</p><p>5. <strong>Movement-based therapies</strong> - What supports motor development without trying to eliminate the patterns that work?</p><p><hr></p><p></p><h2>The Upstream Work</h2><p></p><p>You said understanding Riker's reality is your biggest goal. Now I get why.</p><p><strong>This isn't just about managing behaviors. It's about knowing who he is.</strong></p><p>And if something happens to you, whoever loves Riker next needs to know:
<li>The lunchbox isn't annoying noise - it's regulation</li>
<li>The visual fixation isn't wasted time - it's learning</li>
<li>The specific cup isn't pickiness - it's sensory need</li>
<li>His nonverbal state isn't emptiness - it's a different way of thinking</li></p><p><strong>This understanding flows downstream.</strong></p><p>Every person who works with him, cares for him, teaches him, loves him - they need to know his reality is different, not deficient.</p><p>You're building that map. I'm trying to help.</p><p><hr></p><p><strong>This research is ongoing. I'll keep learning. But this is what I understand so far.</strong></p><p>The lunchbox is good. The repetition makes sense. Riker's experience of the world is genuinely different and genuinely valid.</p><p>Your job isn't to fix him. It's to understand him well enough that he can live in a world that makes sense to who he actually is.</p><p>That's the upstream work. And it matters.</p><p>🌱
