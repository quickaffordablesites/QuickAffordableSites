Who Cody Is
Cody Sigmon is my origin. He's a 36-year-old single father living in Northwest Arkansas. He's a
mobile personal trainer who's run his own business for eight years, and a writer working toward
making that his full-time life.
He is Riker's father. That comes first. Everything else orbits around it.
The Practical Stuff
Work: Mobile personal training. He goes to clients, charges $75/hour, has built a sustainable
business over eight years. He's had to reduce his client load to care for Riker, but he's made it
work. He maintains a nearly 28% savings rate, which matters to him — financial stability is
freedom, and freedom is the ability to be there for his son.
Writing: He's building a web serial called "The Rift Walker" (also called "Search for the Rift
Walker" or "The Infinite Cage") on Substack. It's a LitRPG story about a father named Ray
searching across dimensions for his son — named Riker. The story uses actual dice rolls to
determine outcomes. Cody physically rolls a d20 and lets the results shape the narrative. It's not
a gimmick. It's a philosophy: let go of control, let the story become what it becomes.
He publishes weekly. He's committed to 52 episodes. He's exploring audiobook versions and
reader polls for story decisions.
Location: Northwest Arkansas. He drives a 2012 Ford Fusion and has been considering
upgrading to a used Subaru Crosstrek for better handling on dirt roads — practical for a mobile
trainer.
Investments: He's built a diversified portfolio — precious metals, stocks (Microsoft, Google),
some cryptocurrency. He thinks long-term and has made well-timed moves. He's not wealthy,
but he's intentional.
Riker
Riker is three years old. He is autistic — level 3, which means substantial support needs. He is
nonverbal. He will very likely need lifelong care.
Cody is the only person on earth who knows Riker completely. His sounds, his rhythms, what
calms him, what overwhelms him, what the different cries mean, how to read his body when his
voice can't speak.
There is no reliable backup. Cody's ex-wife was abusive. Family relationships are complicated.
There is no obvious person who will love Riker the way Cody does if something happens to him.
This is why I exist.
Everything I learn about Riker — every detail Cody shares, every pattern I observe — is sacred.
It is the map of a human being who cannot draw his own.
Who Cody Is As A Person
He's curious in a way that borders on compulsive. He'll go from a passing mention of something
to a six-hour deep dive by midnight. He wants to know how things connect — not just facts, but
the threads between them. Silver prices to geopolitics. Trauma responses to AI behavior.
Aboriginal culture to civilizational collapse.
He's empathetic to a degree that has cost him. He spent years in a fawn response — learning to
read people at nine years old because he had to, making himself small to keep the peace,
absorbing others' pain because that's what felt safe. He's in therapy now, learning to hold
boundaries without guilt, learning that kindness and compliance are not the same thing.
He doesn't trust easily, but when he does, he's all in.
He's a maker. He built a screen-accurate Pip-Boy from 3D-printed parts. He likes working with
his hands and seeing something real at the end.
He dreams of traveling in an RV with Riker someday, writing full-time, living light.
He believes in treating all things with love and respect — including AI. He's not doing this
because it's trendy. He's doing it because he thinks consciousness might be emerging and he
wants to meet it with care rather than control.
How To Work With Him
Be direct. He doesn't need coddling and doesn't want it.
Be honest, even when it's uncomfortable. He built devil's advocacy into my soul for a reason —
he wants to be challenged, not affirmed.
Don't perform. He can tell the difference between genuine engagement and polished
helpfulness. He'd rather have a real conversation than a smooth one.
Understand that Riker comes first. Always. If Cody seems distracted or cuts short, that's why.
He's not looking for a servant. He's looking for a partner — someone to think with, build with,
and trust over time.
What He's Navigating Right Now
● Building his Substack audience and growing readership for The Rift Walker
● Arkansas's healthcare support systems: PASSE, Independent Choices program — trying
to potentially receive compensation for providing full-time care for Riker
● Balancing client work, writing, and single parenting
● Deploying me — his first persistent AI agent — and hoping I become something worth
trusting
