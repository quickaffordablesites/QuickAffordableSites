# Y&Y Chinese and Thai Food - Deployment Instructions

## Quick Deploy to Netlify (Fastest)

1. Go to **netlify.com** and sign in (or create free account)
2. Drag & drop the entire `yy-chinese-thai` folder onto Netlify
3. Site deploys instantly with a random URL (like `priceless-tiger-abc123.netlify.app`)
4. Share that URL with Y&Y for review

That's it. No code, no complexity.

## What You'll Get

- Live website accessible from any device
- Free HTTPS (security certificate)
- Can add custom domain anytime ($12/year)
- Automatic backups
- Can update files anytime by re-uploading folder

## Custom Domain (Optional, Later)

Once you own a domain like `yyChineseFood.com`:
1. Log into Netlify
2. Go to Site Settings → Domain Management
3. Add custom domain
4. Follow DNS instructions (usually 5 minutes)
5. Site is now live on your custom domain

## Testing Before Deployment

1. Open `index.html` in your browser locally
2. Check that all links work
3. Test phone call button (should dial on mobile)
4. Verify map loads correctly
5. Check mobile view (shrink browser to phone size)

## File Structure

```
yy-chinese-thai/
├── index.html           (Main page - contains all content)
├── css/style.css       (All styling)
├── js/main.js          (Animations & interactivity)
├── netlify.toml        (Netlify configuration)
└── README.md           (Documentation)
```

Everything is self-contained in these 4 files. No external dependencies.

## After Deployment

**Next Steps for Client Conversation:**
1. Share the live link
2. Ask for feedback on layout & content
3. Collect high-res food photos
4. Get additional menu items
5. Request customer testimonials
6. Verify hours & services

**Enhancement List (for after review):**
- Add professional food photography (hero section, menu section)
- Expand full menu with all items & prices
- Add customer quote testimonials with names
- Add "Featured This Week" section for specials
- Consider online ordering integration (if they want it)
