## Design Philosophy

**Simple > Complex**  
Every element serves the mission: convince a small business owner that $100 is a great deal.

**Speed > Features**  
Fast load times. No JavaScript bloat. No external dependencies. Just pure HTML/CSS/JS.

**Honest > Flashy**  
Real value. Real price. Real examples. No gimmicks.

**Professional > Corporate**  
Modern, clean, trustworthy. But not sterile. Uses your brand colors (blue + orange).
