### Update Contact Info
Edit these in `index.html`:
- Phone number (search for "tel:")
- Facebook page name
- Any custom messaging

### Colors
If you want to adjust the warm palette:
- Edit CSS variables at top of `css/style.css`
- Primary warm: #D4A574
- Accent orange: #E8704A

- Warm colors (tan, orange) = home, comfort, care
- Photo-forward gallery = dogs are the stars
- Story section = emotional connection (Braveheart)
- Simple pricing = no BS, fair rates
- Friendly copy = genuine, not corporate

**Target conversion:** Personal recommendation + "she really cares" messaging
