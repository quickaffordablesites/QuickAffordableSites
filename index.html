                <h3>Can I edit the website after launch?</h3>
                <p>Yes! You own all the files. Edit text, images, layouts—whatever you want. We provide you with full credentials and documentation so you can manage it yourself or hire someone else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I change my domain later?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely. You own the domain credentials from day one. Transfer it, renew it, or switch to a different registrar—it's completely under your control.</p>

                <h3>What's included in the $150?</h3>
                <p>You get a free sample design. If you approve it and purchase, we build your original site with your photos and content. Then you get one free revision round (one batch of change requests). Additional revisions are $50 each.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I don't like the sample?</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I don't like the revision?</h3>
                <p>You own the original sample site files. If the revision isn't what you wanted, we'll give you the original files and you keep them. No refund needed—you already own the code.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How fast can you build my preview?</h3>
