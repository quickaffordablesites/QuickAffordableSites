# The Rift Walker: Lost in the Infinite - Project File

## Status: IN DEVELOPMENT (Started Feb 8, 2026)

## Concept
Browser-based text RPG game set in Cody's Rift Walker universe

**Core Hook:** You're a newly awakened rift walker trying to get home - but you don't know how to control your ability yet

## Scope (Proof of Concept)
- **Playtime:** 1-2 hours
- **Dimensions:** 3 (Ashen Wastes, Neon Slums, Crossroads)
- **Mechanics:** D20 + 5 stats (STR/REF/END/INT/CHA), resource management
- **Endings:** Multiple based on choices/preparation
- **Tech:** HTML/CSS/JS (like website build)

## Stats System (Cody's Original)
- **STR** (Strength) - Physical power, combat, intimidation
- **REF** (Reflex) - Speed, dodging, precision
- **END** (Endurance) - Health, stamina, harsh conditions
- **INT** (Intelligence) - Problem-solving, rift mechanics
- **CHA** (Charisma) - Persuasion, deception, reading people

## Character Archetypes (5)
1. **The Soldier** - High STR/END, low INT/CHA
2. **The Drifter** - Balanced REF/CHA
3. **The Scholar** - High INT, low STR
4. **The Medic** - High END/INT
5. **The Con Artist** - High CHA/REF

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Core engine + first dimension
- **Week 2:** Content (3 dimensions, encounters)
- **Week 3:** Polish, testing, deploy
- **Target:** 2-3 weeks autonomous work

## Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JS (zero dependencies)
- localStorage for save/load
- Mobile-responsive
- Dark rift aesthetic UI

## Story Context Read
- All 11 Substack episodes absorbed
- Full understanding of rift mechanics, tone, universe rules
- Ray's story provides world context but game is separate narrative

## Design Philosophy
- Roadwarden-inspired (exploration, resource tension, consequences)
- Mystery over melodrama (discovery gameplay)
- Brutal but fair (failure teaches, success feels earned)
- True to Cody's universe tone
