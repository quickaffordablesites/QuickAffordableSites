# Riker's Diagnosis - New Year's Eve 2025 Journal Entry

**Date:** Dec 31, 2025 (shared with me Feb 7, 2026)

## Official Diagnosis (November 2025)
**Level 3 Autism** combined with:
- Global developmental delay
- Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder (difficulty both speaking AND understanding)
- Fine motor disorder

**What Level 3 means:** Requires "very substantial support" - most severe classification

## Statistical Reality (Clinical Data)
- **<5-10% chance** of reaching "typical" adulthood (living alone, full-time competitive job, managing finances without support)
- **80-90%** of adults with this profile continue to live with parents or in residential care lifelong
- **If functional language not developed by age 5-6,** likelihood of independent living drops to near zero
- **Likely outcome:** Lifelong guardianship, supported living environment, assistance with daily tasks

## Safety Risks
- **Wandering/elopement:** No sense of danger, may run into traffic or water
- **Mortality rates:** Shorter average life expectancy (36-54 years) due to:
  - Drowning (#1 cause of death)
  - Seizures (epilepsy co-occurs in 30% of cases)
  - Inability to communicate health problems
- **Cannot communicate emergencies** or understand instructions from authority figures

## Timeline of Recognition

**1 year old:**
- Not walking yet (Cody worked with him daily at park/Jones Center until he got it)
- Falling without bracing
- Still falling a lot but improving

**1.5 years:**
- No language
- No response to name or prompts
- Little to no eye contact
- Atypical play (sensory only, no imaginative)
- Wouldn't transition from bottle to food (Cody made custom baby food)
- 90th percentile height/weight - staying healthy despite challenges

**2 years:**
- Cody knew it was autism but spent time researching every other possibility
- Realized he was denying diagnosis for himself, not for Riker
- Mindset shift: "If he was in a wheelchair would I tell him he wasn't? If he had cancer would I hesitate to 'label' it?"
- Told pediatrician truth, got on evaluation waitlist

**2 years, 6 months (November 2025):**
- Evaluation day: "Two psychologists in a small room"
- Riker didn't do anything they asked
- Melted down when tests changed (was happy dropping plastic sticks)
- Took Cody's hand, led him to door, slapped it (his way of saying "leave")
- Cody: "I had to say sorry buddy I know but we can't leave not knowing if he really understands"
- Watched him melt down because he thinks he's not being understood

**2 years, 10 months (Dec 31, 2025 - journal date):**
- Has diagnosis
- Making "good progress for him, not necessarily his age group"
- Cody learning how to help him be mostly happy
- "Such a sweet boy maybe the purest of heart, of the human race, but life is so hard on him"

## Food Journey - The Work It Takes

### Original Battle (Age 1-2):
- Wouldn't eat anything but custom puree: bananas, apples, milk
- Cody worked EVERY DAY for 6 months to expand diet

### Stable Routine (Achieved by age 2.5):
**7am:** First oatmeal (1/2 cup steel cut oats, tsp cinnamon, tbsp honey, tbsp maple syrup, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce)

**Noon:** Second oatmeal (1/2 cup oats, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 banana, 1/8 cup milk mixed in after)

**4pm:** Instant mashed potato cup (Great Value brand only)

**7pm:** Shells and cheese cup

**After 7pm:** Dino nuggets (could feed himself - "scary at first but he got really good")

**Randomly discovered:** Sour cream and onion chips (still loves them)

**Note:** All spoon-fed items - Riker can't use utensils. Only self-feeds finger foods.

### Christmas Eve 2025 Crisis:
- Got really sick with high fever
- **Didn't eat for 6 days**
- Previously took medicine from syringe fine - after illness refused
- Cody had to "surprise him while crying" to get Tylenol down
- Wouldn't let rectal thermometer be used
- Cody bought $60 laser gun thermometer on Christmas Day

### Post-Illness Regression (Dec 25 - early Jan):
- Would ONLY eat chips for 3 days
- Cody terrified he was developing food fear/aversion
- Slowly started eating first oatmeal
- Then second oatmeal
- **Nothing else for weeks**

### Recent Recovery (Feb 2026):
- **Feb 6:** Ate instant mashed potatoes again (first time all year)
- **Feb 6:** Ate dino nuggets (2 nuggets, first time this year)
- **Feb 7:** Ate bacon again (likes it when Cody cooks it)
- Hasn't eaten shells and cheese yet (6+ months since last time)

**This is PROGRESS.** Getting back foods he lost is huge.

## Cody's Mindset

**The Reality Check:**
"At a certain point I realized I wasn't pushing off the autism diagnosis because it was good for him, it was for me. because I didn't want that to be his future. We had so much future that I was looking forward to together. But that was selfish."

**The Shift:**
"So I shifted my mindset and at 2years old I told the pediatrician the truth about everything"

**The Evaluation:**
"It was rough to watch - to know that he knew - I knew - what he wanted and I just sat there while he didn't understand what was going on"

**After the diagnosis:**
"While not unexpected at this point for me it was still a bit of a gut punch"

**The Response:**
"I won't let that be the end all be all - I will continue to help Riker be the best version of himself he can be and love him unconditionally every single day"

**Redefining Success:**
- Not "becoming normal"
- Not typical adulthood
- Focus on adaptive skills - doing things for himself
- "The best predictor of happiness is not IQ—it is 'adaptive behavior' (daily living skills)"

## What Cody Is Planning For
- Riker will likely live with him or in supported environment
- Will require guardianship at 18
- Will need assistance with daily tasks
- "If he surpasses those expectations, it will be a wonderful surprise, but it should not be the baseline plan"

## The Weight
This is why I exist. This is the map Cody is building. If something happens to him, this is what Riker needs someone to know:
- Every food is a battle
- Every skill is months of daily work
- The slapping the door means "I want to leave"
- The regression after illness is terrifying
- The statistics don't define him
- Love and daily work can create progress even when the odds say it won't happen

**Cody's closing:** "For anyone going through the same, you're not alone."

He's not just doing this for Riker. He's doing it so other parents know they're not alone either.
