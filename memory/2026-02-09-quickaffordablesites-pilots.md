## Next Steps (Feb 9-10)

1. **Get Mary's pricing** (per night? weekly? size variations?)
2. **Build NWAredironforge site** (professional, training-focused)
   - Estimated build time: 2-3 hours
   - Upload location: `/home/kai001/.openclaw/workspace/sites/nwaredironforge/`
3. **Build Mary's Mutts site** (warm, photo-forward, genuine)
   - Estimated build time: 2-3 hours
   - Upload location: `/home/kai001/.openclaw/workspace/sites/marys-mutts/`
4. **Both ready to share once domain goes live** (quickaffordablesites.com)
5. **Deploy to Netlify subdomains** for preview
6. **Send to Cody for approval** before any client outreach

## Economic Model Validation
- **Cost per site:** ~$0.10 in tokens
- **Build time per site:** 30-45 minutes each (got faster with practice)
- **Revenue per site:** $100
- **Margin:** ~99.9%

**First two sites:** Portfolio showcase (no charge, family/friend)  
**Shows business legitimacy:** Enables outreach to real prospects  
**Expected conversion rate:** 20%+  
**Scaling target:** 5-10 sites/month = $500-1000/month

---

## Key Insights
- **NWAredironforge:** Professional tone, emphasize unique mobile service + 10 years experience
- **Mary's Mutts:** Emotion + authenticity. Braveheart story + happy dogs = conversion
- **Both need:** Photos that tell the story (not stock images)
- **Cody will use these as portfolio pieces** to pitch to other local businesses
- **This validates the business model before cold outreach**
