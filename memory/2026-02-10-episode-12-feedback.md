# Episode 12 Raw Feedback (Feb 10, 2026)

## Summary
Episode 12 strong action with emotional core. Skidd becomes active hero, F.E.N.R.I.S. recurring threat, data retrieved. Needs tightening in Car 12 escape sequence and one clarity pass on trap mechanics.

## Detailed Feedback

### What's Working
- ✅ Skidd commandeers bike, chases under fire, executes high-G pivot rescue (character arc payoff)
- ✅ F.E.N.R.I.S. as consequence of earlier choices (not just random reappearance)
- ✅ Jump sequence genuinely tense (failed reflex check, dangling by leg, Mag-Lock catch)
- ✅ Riker as anchor ("If I die here, he's alone") - emotional core, not melodrama
- ✅ Escalating complications (trap in Car 12 → escape F.E.N.R.I.S. → jump train → escape Apex depot)

### Needs Tightening

**1. Car 12 escape (first ~1000 words) - condense to 500-600**
- Ray tries door, fails (good consequence: shoulder pops)
- Ray realizes he needs traction, uses plasma cutter
- Ray tries door again, succeeds
- ISSUE: Middle section dwells, emotional spiral repeats
- FIX: Cut repetition. One powerful thought about Riker, then move forward

**2. F.E.N.R.I.S./lubricant trap timing - narrative clarity needed**
- Ray fails timing check (rolls 12, needs 13)
- Consequence: gets clipped for -2 damage
- But then: Ray still escapes fine. The failure doesn't cascade forward
- FIX: Either machine keeps more control, OR Ray spots weak hull spot FIRST, then deliberately provokes cannon (tactical, not lucky)

**3. Why provoke the cannon?**
- Ray taints machine → it fires → cannon hits weak spot → hull opens
- Reads like Ray knew that would happen
- FIX: Have Ray spot weakness in hull FIRST, then: "The crack. If I make it angry enough..."

**4. Jump sequence needs one more sensory layer**
- Got: wind, sound, visual blur
- Missing: true vertigo feeling. One sentence about weightlessness before Mag-Lock catches
- FIX: "For one terrible second, I wasn't attached to anything. The world was falling away faster than I could grab it."

**5. "Momentum. Keep Moving" repeats too close**
- Thought after F.E.N.R.I.S. scene, then again before jump
- Same-scene repetition dulls impact
- FIX: Use once powerfully, OR vary second: "No thinking. Just Riker"

**6. Broken ribs vs. Athletics check (mechanical follow-through)**
- Ray takes -6 damage (12/22 HP), broken ribs, severe hip trauma
- Then immediately needs DC 14 check to pull onto moving bike
- Ray passes (rolls 17) but broken ribs make this nearly impossible, not just painful
- FIX: Either bump DC to 16, OR have Ray pass but show the cost (screams, vision whites out, Skidd has to help)

**7. Landing is slightly abrupt**
- "APEX TURRETS FIRING" → "We're clear!" — no breath
- FIX: One line where Ray notices lights fade, catches breath, before Skidd's triumph

### What Episode Accomplishes
✅ Skidd proves loyalty under fire  
✅ Ray improvises with environment (lubricant, weak hull, timing)  
✅ Data retrieved (objective complete)  
✅ Dice rolls mattered (jump failed, Mag-Lock catch saved him, broken ribs)  
✅ Riker anchor never melodramatic  
✅ New mystery: What IS the data?  
✅ Apex escalation: They have face, bounty active, now Ray stole their secrets  

## Open Question
When Ray wakes 30 min later, is he surprised? Does he know sedative duration? Affects whether disoriented/panicked/focused.

## Outline Context (Not Yet Shared)
Cody has major story outline in his head (not written). Mentioned:
- Dice rolls will change everything (like DM running campaign)
- Story parallels real life with Riker (roll of the dice for diagnosis, therapies, everything)
- Piston has a role later (currently forgettable but intentional — not big bad)
- Story NOT about rescuing Riker as conventional save — about Ray learning how to meet Riker where he actually is
- Riker is not McGuffin — has whole outlined arc
